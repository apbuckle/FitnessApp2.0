<h1>Iron Terminus </h1>

What is presented now is a bare foundation for the app I plan to design and implement. With years of experience in the fitness industry I wanted to create a full sourse training app that appeals to all levels, being the only place one needs to go thier fitness needs.

This app will be built with 3 ojectives. 
1) A means to track one's goals through a profile, recording personal records for weight lifting and cadio activites, i.e bench press max or 5k race times. The profile is also where custom workouts and training will be stored that the user has created. Along the means of tracking, this app needs to have the ability to track and record cardio activities both stationary and dynamic outdoor activities (road/mountain bikng, hiking, walking, and running). Built in GPS tracking to follow outdoor activites in distances and times.  But also have the ability to sync up with bluetooth to modern cardio machines to record relevant information.

2A) A source for finding workouts to easily follow along during a gym session. Interactive list so a user can just tap to indicate they completed a set or exercise or workout and have it logged. Provide a short list of weekly/special workouts an user can chose from directly, examples are shown currently.  This will be very similar to how Spotify provides weekly mix list to listen to. But a user should be able to have more control over thier workouts, so there will be the ability to create custom workouts and save to profile. A means to set up repeat workouts in a calender or alarm type set up that will notify what workout is set up for that day, similar to how a daily alarm works or reminders on a calender. 

2B) Not just a source for weight training but also a source for runners focused on training programs of all levels preparing for various distances.  This will include built in calculations on pace and times for various running modes during a training program.  i.e. someone wanting to improve thier 5k time can enter data about thier current run time and select a mode of running (perhaps a speed workout doing x 400m at y speed with z rest time). This information will specific to the user and saved in the profile to quickly navigate to.

3) An open resource for exercises, muscle groups, and tips and information on health and wellness.  A user can look up an exercise and see detailed information about primary muscles and secondary muscle groups, diagrams on how to perform the exercise and any tips or variations and how they affect the muscle.  Can also look up by means of area of the body and break down to what excerises work that area.  This information should be accessible easily via the workout page during a session to quickly see what they need to do and variations without losing thier current workout session.  

As you can see this app will have a lot of huge features that will be more advanced than the foundation shown here.  I want this to be the place for all fitness needs and resources at your finger tips.  

Minor features to include:
Changing color schemes (pick your favorite teams colors, night mode or day modes).
Duel timers to set during a workout for rest and start.
Workout exercise randomizer, pick how many exercises and let it randomly create a workout for you.
A means to connect socially or with other users



Prensted currently showcases an user profile with example form, list of created genral workouts to chose from, and a resource library of exercises with information about muscles groups.  

But where this app will go and become is far more advanced and integrated than where it is now.

*This application doesn't not bring in a third party API at this time. That will be included in future builds
